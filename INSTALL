I strongly suggest to install ruby-agi using gem, 
	% gem install ruby-agi
To update your existing ruby-agi using gem,  try
	% gem update ruby-agi

If you don't have gem intalled on your computer, download it from here
	http://www.rubygems.org

Alternatively, do
	1. ruby extconf.rb
	2. make install
