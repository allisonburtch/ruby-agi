This library comes with absolutely no warranty.

ruby-agi is a library to write AGI scripts in ruby language for Asterisk. ruby-agi does not depend of Asterisk Manager.
There have a very simple AGI script in example/call_log.rb.
I couldn't write any tutorial for ruby-agi and I am not good at it, if anybody want to give me a hand on writing documentation and tutorial, would be greatly appreciated.
