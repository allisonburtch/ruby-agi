This is a fork of the original ruby-agi version 1.1.2 code, which is located @ rubyforge.  
The reason for this fork is that this library complains if you try and use it with ActiveRecord.  Aside from that, this library functions the same way.

Original notes still located below. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library comes with absolutely no warranty.

ruby-agi is a library to write AGI scripts in ruby language for Asterisk. ruby-agi does not depend of Asterisk Manager.
There have a very simple AGI script in example/call_log.rb.
I couldn't write any tutorial for ruby-agi and I am not good at it, if anybody want to give me a hand on writing documentation and tutorial, would be greatly appreciated.

Here are a sites that may help to know more about ruby-agi
http://ruby-agi.rubyforge.org           (ruby-agi homepage)

Feel free to send me email, if you don't find any answer related to ruby-agi
